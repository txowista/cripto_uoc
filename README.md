To run it you need the [sage program]  (http://www.sagemath.org/)

Once installed, it runs:
```
sage
```
and once inside the sage console:
```
notebook()
```
Open your web browser to:
 
[http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

Since sage uses python if you want to use an IDE do the following:

```
sage -sh
```

And from the console launches your favourite idea

```
[path/to/ide/]

```
